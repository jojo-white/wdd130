    <hl>About me:</hl>
    <h2>Hey, my name is Joseph, but you can call me JoJo.</h2>
    <p>This is my third semester in college, and my plan is to get a minor in computer science and a major in physics with an emphasis on astronomy. I like to make music, solve Rubik's cubes, and exercise. I work at Home Depot, so I get to learn about all sorts of home improvement stuff.</p>
