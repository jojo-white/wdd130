Website topic: Space

I want my website to be an information resource about things in space, such as satellites or stars. I'm rather knowledgable about space, as I tend to look things up in my spare time and learn what I can. It could explain certain things about the solar system or of the galaxy. I could try to give live information about voyager I or voyager II, or talk about information about black holes and pictures we have. After all, don't we want to know what lies in the infinite abyss that lies above us in the sky? I know I do. It could help us learn plenty of things about physics to solve lots of problems we have here on Earth.
